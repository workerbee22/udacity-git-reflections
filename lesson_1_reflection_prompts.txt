How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    A: Wasn't that easy to then spot the changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    A: Allow you to easily go back to working versions, give me confidence I can always go back !!!

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    A: Commits manually mean they should be 'valid' and working code, but could be too large to sift through, or too many if small.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    A: ensure valid changes by ensuring each commit has ALL the files managed by the repo.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    A: git log to list all commits on a repo on all files. git diff to see changes between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    A: Will allow me to go back, and also to more easily find and diagnose bugs.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    A: Setup Git locally and talking to the new Google Cloud Source Repository (CSR)
