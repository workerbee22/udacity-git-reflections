When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A: Collaborating with other Devs, or make public, or open-source.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    A: Pull manually because multiple changes/COMMITS might be made to the
    version on GitHub by people directly, or they have synched up other commits.
    Want to control when/how we pull code down to our local repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A: Fork is a GitHub feature like a clone of a repo. Clones are copies of
    repos locally or on remotes. Branches are a series of commits, from tip of
    a branch back to each commit's parent, going back to initial commit that
    has NO parent. Forks and clones are whole repos. Branch is a series of
    commits within a repo. Use branches for different versions of code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    A: You can see the differences in shared code. Can resolve
    collaboration conflicts.
